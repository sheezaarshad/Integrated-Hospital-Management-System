The Integrated Hospital Management System (IHMS) represents an innovative approach to managing healthcare services across multiple hospitals through a single, cohesive platform. This web-based system is designed to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare delivery by integrating diverse functionalities into a unified interface. Initially, users access the system as guests, where they can explore a comprehensive directory of available hospitals, doctors, laboratories, pharmacies, and medicines. The platform facilitates user registration, enabling individuals to engage more deeply with the system by booking or canceling medical appointments, ordering medicines, and requesting blood sample collections for laboratory analysis. A key feature of the IHMS is its support for multiple hospital databases, each tailored to manage specific aspects such as doctors, patients, staff, laboratory operations, and pharmacy inventories. This modular approach ensures that each hospital's data is handled independently, maintaining both security and data integrity. Additionally, the IHMS offers a unique opportunity for users to contribute to the system by adding their own hospitals, thereby expanding the network and fostering a collaborative healthcare ecosystem. The IHMS not only improves operational efficiency within individual hospitals but also enhances the overall patient experience by providing a centralized platform for accessing and managing healthcare services. Through its integrated functionalities and user-centric design, the IHMS aims to streamline healthcare administration, support efficient hospital management, and improve patient outcomes across a broad network of healthcare providers.
